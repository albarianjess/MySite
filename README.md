## My Personal Website

I'm learning how to program, and I thought the best way to get started is to make a personal website.
I made this site to keep track of my ideas, accomplishments, and goals. I want others to be able
to see what I'm up to and who I am.

#Ashes
Ashes, or ashesz, is the name I use for game characters and game accounts. I ran into the name when trying to name
my mage on WOW, and it just stuck after that. I like incense and playing with fire, so I thought ashes and I went
well together :)
